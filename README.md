# Neon-Cityscape-Generator (Proposal)

This project aims to procedurally generate a vast explorable 3D Neon Cityscape. The cities generated will have a classic [80's neon aesthetic](https://imgur.com/a/olsT106), with bright piercing colours and different types of wacky building designs (also procedurally generated) to fit in with the cyber-dystopian theme.

You will also be able to import music into the city generator. The different objects and buildings in the city will react according to the music, pulsating and changing colours. There will be plenty of light sources that will be interactable with the music as pretty much every building and object will have neon lights.

I plan on completing a few tutorials online on the fundamentals of procedural generation to properly understand what I am implementing. I also plan on drawing inspiration from the endless supply of artwork in this 'genre' like the piece linked above. From these I will gather ideas on what kind of structures I can generate.

# Description

A procedurally generated city is built around the player and the camera explores it. Each building is unique and made up of basic voxels cubes generated on the fly, producing some interesting looking structures. Street lights litter each road which react and pulsate to the BPM of the chosen song. Audio Visualizers are also scattered along the streets that react to whatever sound file is given.

# Proudest Achievement

Despite the simple looking world I'm happy with how the overall atmosphere of the project turned out. I think the fog and street lights produce that neon aesthetic I was going for when I set out to develop this project. The simple design of the world also contributes to the atmosphere as there is a sort of an eerie vibe throughout which I feel elevates the experience.
