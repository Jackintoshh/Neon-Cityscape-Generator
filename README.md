# Neon-Cityscape-Generator

This project aims to procedurally generate a vast explorable 3D Neon Cityscape. The cities generated will have a classic [80's neon aesthetic](https://imgur.com/a/olsT106), with bright piercing colours and different types of wacky building designs (also procedurally generated) to fit in with the cyber-dystopian theme.

You will also be able to import music into the city generator. The different objects and buildings in the city will react according to the music, pulsating and changing colours. There will be plenty of light sources that will be interactable with the music as pretty much every building and object will have neon lights.
